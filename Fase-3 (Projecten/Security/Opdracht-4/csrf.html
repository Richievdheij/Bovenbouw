<!-- Login as the new user. This is what an attacker would do using CSRF.
Then click the button in the original tab. Because you are logged in as a different user,
the attacker learns that you clicked the button. -->

<!-- In this assignment try to see if WebGoat is also vulnerable for a login CSRF attack.
Leave this tab open and in another tab create a user based on your own username prefixed with csrf-.
So if your username is tom you must create a new user called csrf-tom. -->
