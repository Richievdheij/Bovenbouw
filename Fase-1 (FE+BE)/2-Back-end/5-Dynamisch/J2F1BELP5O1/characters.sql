(2, 'Captain America', 'captianamerica.jpg', 3585, 'Captain America is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. \r\n\r\nCaptain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics\' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.  The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield that he throws as a projectile. \r\n\r\nCaptain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government\'s efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in modern times.

She was originally characterized as a supervillain and adversary of Batman, but she has been featured in a series since the 1990s which portrays her as an antiheroine, often doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The character thrived since her earliest appearances, but she took an extended hiatus from September 1954 to November 1966 due to the developing Comics Code Authority in 1954. These issues involved the rules regarding the development and portrayal of female characters that were in violation of the Comics Code, a code which is no longer in use.

During their war with the First Evil, Buffy enacted a plan to activate every Potential Slayer in the world, abolishing the traditional line of Chosen Ones, before dedicating herself to gathering and training the ever-growing number of Slayers. She created the Slayer Organization, protecting the world and Slayers when the supernatural had then become public knowledge.  \r\n\r\nRevealed she had been long involved in an ancient prophecy that would bring about Twilight as an evolution to replace the Earth dimension, Buffy prevented this destroying the Seed of Wonder, thus bringing about the end of magic. She established herself in San Francisco, where she continued her Slayer duties and eventually restored magic on Earth, taking responsibility for its new rules with the Vampyr book. Ultimately, Buffy was the Slayer that defined the battle of the Reckoning, which allowed Slayers to exist and work towards a better future, changing the course of history up to the 23rd century.', 'orchid', 157, 74, 'Wooden stake', 'Shirt'),
